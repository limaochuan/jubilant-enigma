# jubilant-enigma
hello world!

Jubilant-enigma is only a recommended name. 

It's only a "hello world"!

I learned about programming when I was a freshman about 5 years ago. In the next years I study in the micro-electronics.

I want to get back to software and maybe in the future to be a PG/SE. Now I only know the basic of C/C++, but I want master them, and learn more about C#/unity (interested in game-developement).

hope everything goes well!
